### General information about the map / Behind the scenes and trivia.
This map was a short project for the Hammer time or i mean the Hammer mod for Quake, this journey started as soon as i asked for Egyptian themed textures and Pyro found them for me. I did a small paper sketch and went through with it, it differed a lot from the paper sketch, and i knew i needed to jump straight into protocol 999 to avoid having any problems with map size.

The idea came because i've been listening to Twenty one pilots a lot, the name Nico and the niners came into play, so a basic idea was given : Chumastic map (multiple path for the keys) and a 9 shambler fight at the end with a powerup (originally the Quad was mean't to be a secret but i decided just going with "Let it be a rampage"), the idea was mean't the Hammer was the only usable weapon, then i added some weapons as secrets (rewarding the player if the weapons are found), lastly i let the player have in the main or critical path the SG, since i map for nightmare the enforcers were a very risky fight, so i let the SG shine throghout and help the player.

What i call the Silver key path 2 (left path, the machine room) was mean't to be more platform-y i was sketching out with some func_trains but it didn't seem to fit, rabbit came into play with trigger_timed func_doors and i loved it... so it was kept, with it, it stuck short and simple... And lastly my favorite part of the map was the first fiend fight and the Thunderbolt secret... this is a funny one because it's solvable, just using hammer jumping, but somehow i feel my brain did it not that i did it, at times at playtesting i found it very "oh come on" but it's still fun!

The last anecdote is that the part where the death knight jumps in the machine room it was complex to do, i tried using movedir but i couldn't make it work the way i wanted, Commoncold did an entity scripting of a trigger jump that deactivates after some seconds (or trigger), i give him the credit for doing so, it was an amazing use of relays and the trigger_jump.

Hope you enjoyed my map! best wishes and Excelsior!
